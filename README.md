My final project to fulfill the requirements for my bachelor's degree at Gunadarma University is titled "Development of a Frost Shop Product Information Application Using Flutter." This project focuses on creating an Android application using Flutter, a cross-platform framework, to provide comprehensive product information for Frost Shop. The app is designed to improve user experience by offering a streamlined interface, easy navigation, and detailed product descriptions, enabling customers to access essential product details quickly and efficiently.
